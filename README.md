**Gotta Catch 'em All!!**

This project utilises the React Router to keep track of Pokemon and their toys 
in a single page Javascript web app that is served with Rails. We have taken
special precausion to follow the Flux structure of passing data around within 
the app in a one-way-loop.

## React Components
- `PokemonsIndex`
- `PokemonIndexItem`
- `PokemonDetail`
- `ToysIndex`
- `ToyIndexItem`
